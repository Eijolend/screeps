URGENT:
*Tower logic:
	-> Tower filling should probably be a separate task from filling
	-> Towers should be prioritized in an emergency and civilians should help fill them in an emergency.
*centralize repairWall tasks as well

soon:

eventually:
*go over whole task system again and try to standardize things more
*recycler role alternatives, if there is no valid spawn rather than failsafe in roleCivilian
*find a way to avoid energy starving when too many civilians are present

observe:
*getting task in runners and civilians from storage should recalculate if storage is empty
 (should be solved now that a successful withdraw action resets the task)

maybe:
*integrate military creeps fully with task system (or actually, just take them out of the task system)
