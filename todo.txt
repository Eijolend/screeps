URGENT:

soon:
*implement a solid system for creeps staying in homeRoom if they get lost in another room
*rethink a possibility for targetless tasks (currently laborants simply target themselves instead of the position where they should be)
*implement gradual permission system for contact with other players
*code that checks if enough resources are available for what is ordered form labs (also see below)
*code that automatically distributes resources between terminals if they are needed for the labs (maybe add to labManager module, although a generic redistribution module, where other modules can request things might be better);
*related to the above: a cleaner way for managing energy to be stored in the terminal
*also related to the redistribution system: a non-tempcode way to help rooms with energy
*counting error for laborants - is there a possiblity that == OK is called more than once a tick?

eventually:
*go over whole task system again and try to standardize things more
*integrate military creeps fully with task system (or actually, just take them out of the task system)
*recycler role alternatives, if there is no valid spawn rather than failsafe in roleCivilian
*find a way to avoid energy starving when too many civilians are present
*optimize remoteRunners even more exactly
*number of carry parts needed for remote mines is not calculated properly if there is no storage yet, we have to update all manually
*remoterunner pathfinding to not ignore roads over big swamps

observe:
*runners should now prioritize towers (might be too severely prioritized)
*civilians will help filling towers in an emergency
*dedicated upgrader for RCL 8 rooms should be working (think about doing the same for lower RCL)
*runner prioritization in an energy shortage might be too severe
*getting task in runners and civilians from storage should recalculate if storage is empty
 (should be solved now that a successful withdraw action resets the task)

maybe:
