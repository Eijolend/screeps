URGENT:
*next up: remote mining
*colonizing

soon:
*Towers should be prioritized in an emergency and civilians should help fill them in an emergency.
*Rewrite filltasks to choose closest task.

eventually:
*

observe:
*find a way to avoid energy starving when too many civilians are present
 (should be okay because runners calculate tasks first)
*getting task in runners and civilians from storage should recalculate if storage is empty
 (should be solved now that a successful withdraw action resets the task)

maybe:
*integrate military creeps fully with task system
