URGENT:
*code that checks if enough resources are available for what is ordered form labs (also see below)
*code that automatically distributes resources between terminals if they are needed for the labs (maybe add to labManager module, although a generic redistribution module, where other modules can request things might be better);
*Restructure spawning for RCL 8 rooms to have a dedicated upgrader instead of lots of civilians (maybe even before that)
*Tower logic:
	-> Tower filling should probably be a separate task from filling
	-> Towers should be prioritized in an emergency and civilians should help fill them in an emergency.

soon:
*rethink a possibility for targetless tasks (currently laborants simply target themselves instead of the position where they should be)

eventually:
*go over whole task system again and try to standardize things more
*integrate military creeps fully with task system (or actually, just take them out of the task system)
*recycler role alternatives, if there is no valid spawn rather than failsafe in roleCivilian
*find a way to avoid energy starving when too many civilians are present
*optimize remoteRunners even more exactly

observe:
*getting task in runners and civilians from storage should recalculate if storage is empty
 (should be solved now that a successful withdraw action resets the task)

maybe:
