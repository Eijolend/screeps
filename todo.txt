URGENT:

soon:
*Towers should be prioritized in an emergency and civilians should help fill them in an emergency.
*Rewrite filltasks to choose closest task.

eventually:
*go over whole task system again and try to standardize things more
*repair tasks would really benefit from a centralized list that is updated sparingly

observe:
*find a way to avoid energy starving when too many civilians are present
 (should be okay because runners calculate tasks first)
*getting task in runners and civilians from storage should recalculate if storage is empty
 (should be solved now that a successful withdraw action resets the task)

maybe:
*integrate military creeps fully with task system
