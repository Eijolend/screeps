to do:
*Rewrite filltasks to choose closest task.
*getting task in runners and civilians from storage should recalculate if storage is empty
*Towers should be prioritized in an emergency and civilians should help fill them in an emergency.

observe:
*find a way to avoid energy starving when too many civilians are present
 (should be okay because runners calculate tasks first)

maybe:
*integrate military creeps fully with task system
