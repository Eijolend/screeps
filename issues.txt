Some issues arise from refactoring the way builders and upgraders work.
These need to be resolved before merging.

* remoteUpgraders still switch to deprecated roles
* remoteUpgraders should be restructured to a special Colonist role and arbitrary remote roles
* repairers still use roleBuilder
* currently no logic for filling towers by non-runners
* currently no logic for wall repairing (move repairer role to civilian? or add additional condition when builders are needed?)
