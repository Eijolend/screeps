Some issues arise from refactoring the way builders and upgraders work.
These need to be resolved before merging.

* remoteUpgraders still switch to deprecated roles, Civilian would be better... make sure that works without spawn
* remoteUpgraders should be restructured to a special Colonist role and arbitrary remote roles
* repairers still use roleBuilder
* currently no logic for filling towers by non-runners
* currently no logic for wall repairing (move repairer role to civilian? or add additional condition when builders are needed?)

IMPORTANT: old roles will need to be switched once this is pushed (or maintain backwards compatibility!)
