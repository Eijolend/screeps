(in no particular order)

Things that I should do urgently.

*tweak respawn so it does not spawn too many civilians while colonists are helping

*find counting error for labs
*make it so labs[2] gets emptied even if no order remaining
*better rotating lab code (will probably also resolve the 2 issues above)
*roll out labs to all rooms
*multi-lab-block support

*clean up code; rewrite roles to use a deliberating & run system

Then:
*labs and boosting

===================================
all the rest:

*implement proper spawning in advance
*spawning proper amounts of remote runners

*spawn dedicated loader creeps if a tower is empty and there are not enough civilians to fill all of them

*only spawn terminalManagers when needed, but I don't want to give up the safety net of an additional runner

*better repairer logic, to minimize traffic jams. Idea: only make a list what needs to be repaired every 500 ticks or so. could be combined with:
*integrate repair into the civilian role

*fix problems with overwriting the queue (fixed... maybe?)

*a better requestList spawning

*automatic nuke defense (at least for one nuke)
*arbitrary remote roles


combat related:
*better tower code
*defensive and offensive creep squads
*siege code
