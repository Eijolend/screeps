(in no particular order)

Things that I should do urgently.

*only spawn terminalManagers when needed, but I don't want to give up the safety net of an additional runner

*better repairer logic, to minimize traffic jams. Idea: only make a list what needs to be repaired every 500 ticks or so. could be combined with:
*integrate repair into the civilian role


*clean up code; write a better system to control on a room basis.

Then:
*labs and boosting

===================================
all the rest:

*implement proper spawning in advance

*spawn dedicated loader creeps if a tower is empty and there are not enough civilians to fill all of them

*remoteUpgraders should be restructured to a special Colonist role and arbitrary remote roles
*fix problems with overwriting the queue (fixed... maybe?)
*monitor of remote mining works like expected
*monitor if not prioritizing repairers will repair enough

*a clean solution to the waypoint dilemma

*dynamic hunter bodies

*a better requestList spawning

combat related:
*better tower code
*defensive and offensive creep squads
*siege code
