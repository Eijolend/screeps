(in no particular order)

I want to respawn - things to figure out before that:

*remote mining with mining and running roles, but also build/maintain streets/containers
*remoteUpgraders should be restructured to a special Colonist role and arbitrary remote roles
*a solution to the two-sources split

*clean up code

===================================
all the rest:

*dynamic hunter bodies

*monitor if not prioritizing repairers will repair enough
*integrate repair into the civilian role
*get civilians to fill towers if under attack

*a better requestList spawning

combat related:
*better tower code
*defensive and offensive creep squads
*siege code
