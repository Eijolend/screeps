(in no particular order)

=====================================
Things for the rewrite:



*limit the number of repairers and wallRepairers
*add remote rooms
*complete functionality
*a modular task list that can be updated in chunks
*overhaul of respawning logic -> port over early respawning from branch master
*clean up code

Then:
*labs and boosting (labs are solved in master)

===================================
all the rest:

*implement proper spawning in advance
*spawning proper amounts of remote runners

*spawn dedicated loader creeps if a tower is empty and there are not enough civilians to fill all of them

*only spawn terminalManagers when needed, but I don't want to give up the safety net of an additional runner

*better repairer logic, to minimize traffic jams. Idea: only make a list what needs to be repaired every 500 ticks or so. could be combined with:
*integrate repair into the civilian role

*fix problems with overwriting the queue (fixed... maybe?)

*a better requestList spawning

*automatic nuke defense (at least for one nuke)
*arbitrary remote roles


combat related:
*better tower code
*defensive and offensive creep squads
*siege code
