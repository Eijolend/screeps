(in no particular order)

I want to respawn (maybe) - things to figure out before that:

*get civilians to fill towers if under attack

*a clean solution to the waypoint dilemma

*clean up code

===================================
all the rest:

*overwrite Creep.prototype.moveTo with ignoreCreeps, high reusePath and a custom stuck check

*remoteUpgraders should be restructured to a special Colonist role and arbitrary remote roles
*fix problems with overwriting the queue (fixed... maybe?)
*monitor of remote mining works like expected
*monitor if not prioritizing repairers will repair enough

*dynamic hunter bodies

*integrate repair into the civilian role

*a better requestList spawning

combat related:
*better tower code
*defensive and offensive creep squads
*siege code
